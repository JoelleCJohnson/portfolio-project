            <p className="text-xl">Having led in management for three years, my pivot to real estate led me to a fascination with data analytics. 
            It was this intrigue that nudged me towards pursuing computer programming. My forte lies in full stack development, particularly backend technologies, data manipulation, and security. 
            An outgoing and team-driven individual, I thrive on conquering new challenges. 
            Outside of coding, my is passionate about nature, family, and community outreach.</p>
